#### Learning project to make a basic rich text editor for user input

While researching my options for a rich text editor to use in a project I decided to try and see  
how much I could recreate a rich text editor in JavaScript on my own as a learning project for fun.  

After a month and a half made it as far as this [app](https://basictexteditorproject.setdelmar.repl.co/)'s capabilities.

GitHub user [xocomil](https://github.com/xocomil) recommended I try refactoring using more of a command pattern.  
GitHub user [jg20019](https://github.com/jg20019) liked that idea and joined the project to help me do that.  

However, as I was commenting on the project to better explain what I had done (before we really dug in),  
I came to realize my whole approach (though having worked thus far) was flawed in that I had relied too  
heavily on innerHTML manipulation. I decided then that it would be best then to start from the beginning again,   
taking the lessons learned and rather applying them more to the dom tree manipulation.  

In that moment though, both [jg20019](https://github.com/jg20019) and myself found ourseleves occupied by more pressing
endeavors, and  
this remains here waiting until more free time is available to spend on it.
